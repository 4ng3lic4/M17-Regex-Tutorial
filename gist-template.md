## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

Example:
A RegEx is the short form of the Regular Expression, which is the sequence of characters that define a pattern. The characters in a RegEx can be alphabets, numbers or special characters. Usually, RegEx is used to find a pattern in a string to replace, delete or modify them. In ES6, a RegEx can be defined by 2 different notations.

Literal notation: The pattern is enclosed between slashes. It is executed in compile time. So, constant patterns can be given in literal notation.
 var regex = /pattern/
Constructor function: The pattern is given inside single quotes. It is executed in runtime. So, flexible patterns can be given in constructor function.
var regex = new RegExp( pattern, optional arguments)
There are different ways of mentioning patterns which are listed below:

Use of Brackets: It is used to mention a particular range of characters in a pattern.

Patterns with brackets	Description
[pattern]	Any one character from the pattern.
[^pattern]	Any one character not from the pattern.
[0-9]	Any one decimal number between 0-9.
[a-z]	Any one character from the lower case alphabets.
[A-Z]	Any one character from the upper case alphabets.
